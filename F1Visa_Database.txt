Moving from F1 to H1B visa Interviewer asked my highest level of education, work location, if I used OPT, about my role, about why I did Masters (and not double Masters) whereas my petition was filed with my Bachelor's as highest degree of education. Cancelled my F1 VISA. Didn't ask for my I-797. Did not request submission of any documents, but collected the passport.

Applied for H1 Renewal Stamping through dropbox. I-140 denied once as I work for a start-up and the company wasn't able to show ability to pay the proffered GC wage. As a result, I was given a 221(g) blue form, asked to submit the above list of documents and appear for an interview. I am a full time employee so the vacancy letter, client letter are not relevant to my case. Our immigration attorney crafted an employment letter that explained this. At the interview, the VO asked about my employment: Petitioner Name, Nature of Business, Employment history with petitioner, Salary The VO then asked to see my W2's. At this point the VO collected my passport and said the case needs additional processing, but i should expect to get my passport back within the normal processing time + an additional couple days. I tried to clarify what that meant, but the VO repeated the above and said no additional documents were required from me.

Facing an unique situation. I applied for B1/B2 visa (through my employer) and went to New Delhi VFS for ten-printing. My last B1/B2 visa was expired in Feb 2017 and so I was eligible for IWP (Interview Waiver Program). I submitted my passports at new delhi VFS. After 3 days I collected my passports from VFS with a letter. It says "we are unable to process your visa application at this time, as we require your presence at the Embassy. Your case has been suspended under section 221(g) of INA until the below indicated process is completed - Fingerprints and Interview. Please bring this letter and your passport to the Embassy on any business day before 10:00 AM within one calendar year from the date of this letter. Please do not make a new appointment" I am not sure what should be the next steps. Letter says that I need to visit Embassy on ANY BUSINESS DAY and I don't need to make any appointment. Does it mean I can go there on any working day without any appointment? Is it a normal scenario? What documents should I carry? I have the invite letter from the US office of my employer. I also have the Visa request letter from my New Delhi employer along with 3 years Income Tax Returns of my employer. And all my documents. What should I do? Please suggest.

I received no slip at the interview. In fact, the interviewer said my visa was approved. However, when I access the status of my visa at https://ceac.state.gov/ceacstattracker/status.aspx, it says administrative processing. What can I do - I'm due to leave for the US in two days, i.e. Friday 8 December 2017.

Dec 18th, 2017
I was technically arrested by the local police and according to my lawyer the case will be expunged after i do some education program. And I had mentioned in DS 160 form "NOT ARRESTED". The VO asked me when and where I graduated from in USA. Answered. How much I am being paid. Answered. Please see I am not an IT professional but a health care professional. She gave me a yellow slip saying administrative processing. No documents asked for.

I went to the visa interview on the 15th nov 2017 where I was asked general questions about my job and then he asked me for my resume and kept my passport and said will get back to you at the earliest Because of my scientific background they  do administrative processing. The case status got updated on 7th dec 2017and status changed to issued on 8th dec 2017. But my visa has expiration date is after one year even though there is a mention of petition expiry date which says 2020 which is confusing. Does that mean i need to renew again after a year ?

Just a usual profile: Did my masters in US, working & been on continuous payroll for the past 5ish years, previously worked for a desi consultancy & currently a FTE for an American firm. This is my second H1B stamping interview @ 7:45 AM slot. This is how the interview went: - Visa officer handed me a brouchure and asked if I have seen that before. I said yes, these are the rights have as a H1B employee - Visa officer then asked for my resume. Handed it over - She then asked about my job responsibilities and about my company. Explained her in detail - Next she asked for my DS-160 confirmation letter. She then gave me a Yellow slip with none of the document request boxes ticked, but has a batch number and Julian date on the top right end. She has my passport, first page of the original I-797, copy of resume & DS-160 confirmation letter I had always been very unfortunate with these visa interviews. My case was on 221G admin processing both the previous times: for student visa & again for my 1st H1B stamping. Attended these previous interviews @ Hyderabad,India consulate & it took nearly 2 months for the 221g processing to clear both the times. Now I am stuck in Vancouver with no passport and have no clue how long I need to wait for this to clear. Anyone with similar experiences from the past (or) currently going through this tough phase, please reply here.

The first set of documents requested(as written in the white slip) were the resume and the questionnaire doc with the responses. I sent the documents the very next day. I received an email on Dec 11th asking me to resubmit the same documents but with more details. I did so the next day(Dec 12th). I got a call from the consulate on Dec 14th that they require an invitation letter from my employer. My immigration attorney mentioned that since I work in US, I don't need any invitation letter instead they will provide me an updated copy of the H1B support letter. My manager also wrote a letter with the description of the project and my role and responsibilities outlined and also why I was critical for the project. I emailed these two letters along with an employment verification document from my employer to the consulate as a response for the invitation letter on Dec 16th. Waiting for a response.

Consulate officer asked basic questions, Passport, Client letter, I797, LCA, Payslips, Annualized Salary. For Client Letter, I mentioned my client does not provide Client Letter and given Vendor Letter. He asked for the contract/agreement between Client and Vendor which I don't have. After collecting all, he gave a slip and asked to wait for another staff. That another person called me on different counter and asked my I129, W2 and few more then asked to wait. Then consular again called me asked do your employer hold any of your Salary. I said "NO" and asked couple of questions to my Wife. Then he said he is done with questions with me. And told they have questions for my Employer and asked to check case status online. Till date my Employer also did not get any update. NO mention of Documents needed in 221(g)

I am visiting India for vacation; decided to get the stamp for new employer on my passport. Submitted my documents through dropbox. Got a 221g white slip asking to appear for interview. VO: Passport and i797 Me: given VO: Who is you employer VO: do you have an end client VO: what is the name VO: what is your designation VO: what are your duties VO: what is your highest education VO: what is your salary VO: how does your work benefit the client after all this he said I know you have the documents I am requesting but we need a scanned copy. I was shocked at this. If I have all the documents that you need, why can't you see it right now..

I directly work as full time employee for one of the top tech companies in us, I also did my masters there and so far worked for the company on opt/stem opt. Vo just asked basic questions related to company/job/degree/major and said we need to do some administrative processing. He did not provide any feedback on why 221g was issued. After some digging around my ds160 form I discovered I made a stupid mistake. For questions, Has anyone ever filed an immigrant petition on your behalf with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services? I selected “Yes” in the explain section I wrote “My company filed H1b petition and it was approved.” It was my mistake I misread the question as has someone filed non-immigrant visa. Now I am a worried and would like to know what are the possibilities will consulate verify with USCIS and find out that I wrongly selected YES while I should have selected NO. (or) will they outright reject the application? Thanks

My VFC was on Sep 21 2017 and my visa appointment date is Sep 22 2017. I work as EC model and I work for a fortune 300 Vendor. Even my client is fortune 250 giant. My counselor asked me basic questions like VO: Took my passport. Looked at screen and said so you work for xxxx Me : Yes mam VO: How long have you been working with them Me: For nearly 1 and half year VO: So who is your client Me: My client is XYZ VO: can you spell it out Me: Spelled it VO: So have you done masters in US Me: Yes mam. I did master in so and so state university VO: what is your current salary Me: XXXXXX VO: What is your current role Me: I work as SQL Business Intelligence developer VO: Where do you live Me: In so and so place in US She then replied me that " You visa is currently refused and handed me with a paper (221g). I asked her is the 221g mam.? she replied me yes and I asked what will me my next steps? she said you will get information in email or through sms. I looked at the page provided to me with case number it says "your visa application has been refused under section 221(g) of u.s immigration and nationality act(ina). no visa shall be issued unless an application is complete" In this page the administrative processing check box is checked. What is the next thing I can expect from the process? I am curious to see how long does it takes to get this resolved.?

Folks , I just wanted to share my experience with you ..  When I was scheduling appointment, I found that i was eligible for a Dropbox.I submitted passport and other documents required on 31-Aug as required in VAC New Delhi.After 4 days I got an email "Your passport is Ready for Pickup " and I thought my stamping is done.I collected my passport on 15-SEP-2017 found a 221g White slip attached with my passport which says to appear for an Interview. Arranged all the docs and went for Interview on 18-SEP. Below are the series of questions which were asked to me Me : Good Morning VO : Namaste VO : What are you going to do in US ? Me : Work VO : Do you have I797 ? Me : yes and showed him VO : who was your previous employer ? Me : Answered correctly VO : Who is your current employer ? Me : Answered correctly VO : Are you working for end client ? Me : Yes VO : Do you End client Letter ? Me : Yes and then I tried to finding in my folder and I did not find where I kept. I was keep on looking and looking. I had about 40 docs and it was misplaced somewhere in between. VO waited for me 2 minutes and handed over me 221G white slip to send me the end client letter and other docs in PDF format on email ID. I told him if he can wait just 2 more minutes but he did not , VO said send us the docs on the email and it will easier and convenient for us to review the docs .once the review process is complete we will ask for a passport . It was such frustrated moment for me.I hated myself for next two days.I had to cancel all my tickets ,I can't work remote because my client is govt client . I have been following up ustravel docs and i did not helped me at all . ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27-OCT-2017 : Visa Issued (Finally After a 1 month 9 Days after the Interview )

The interviewer asked 4 questions. Whom do you work for? Where do you work for? Where do you live? What is your salary? Then gave me 221g, I guess its because mine is an IN house project. I had all the documents with me at the time of interview but the lady at the counter didnt ask for it.

Applied for O visa after been on J 1 visa for 6 yrs. CO kept my passport saying that she needs to confirm if I’m eligible for the transfer of visa class. 2 weeks later I was asked to submit DS 2019 which is for J extension. After multiple emails and finally getting hold of the actual person in the embassy, clarified the misunderstanding on their part and got the stamp after 4 weeks

Aug 13th, 2017
I was asked what I did after passing out from my bachelor's degree (which I'd done in the US previously). I said I'd been working on my master's in Aerospace ever since. Then, I was asked about CPT and OPT. I said I had done three internships on CPT and explained what each of it entailed. Shortly after that I was given a white slip. Bummer. Update: On 2017-09-06, case last updated changed to '2017-09-06'. Update: On 2017-09-07, I received an email asking to submit Passport for further processing. Unfortunately, I had lost my 221(g) letter; I managed to reconstruct the letter using information online. If you received a white slip at Hyderabad and are willing to help, please contact me at cpavankumar993@gmail.com.

No reasons given, just stated needs additional administrative processing. Asked for old passport, said I will hang on to these passports. Didn't respond on timeline. I had been through admin processing once in 2012 for B1/B2 visa. The next H1 in 2013 was smooth. Renewal got stuck in admin processing again. Was applying H1, and H4 for dependents together. All of us got stuck! Last Updated Date: 06/29/2017 Next Update Date: 07/12/2017 (Tuesday) - Admin Processing Next Update Date: 07/13/2017 (Noon) - Issued Passports Collected: 07/14/2017.

Interview was very short. I was asked 3 questions - confirmation of the company name that i work for, location and salary. And then VO issued white slip saying it requires additional administrative processing and said it's usual and takes 3-5 days and asked me to call them if i didn't get a reply in a week. Passport was collected. Not sure why 221g with no details or questions. Didn't ask for any documentation

Could not able to understand what exactly it was meant for. VO just asked only two questions and asked for petition and went inside and checked for 20 mins and came back giving that 221g white slip to me. They did not ask for any documents to submit or so. In that white slip they clicked on the last box which is "Your application requires additional administrative processing before final decision can be made". I really could not understand the situation as they did not either mention or explain what exactly it meant for. Could any one explain this?

I work for an Agricultural seed company. I have been working for this company from the past six and half years. My visa status got changed from F1-OPT-H1B (3 years) -First H1B Extension (3 Years)- Second H1B Extension (Current 3 Years). However, I attended the visa interview only for my F1 stamping in 2006 and never visited India after I joined this company. So I never attended the H1B visa stamping interview. In the mean time, my I-140 got approved with 2013 priority date under EB-2 quota and my wife got H-4 EAD too. Apart from the job, my company is also sponsoring my PhD education in Genetics and Plant Breeding by paying the tuition. Now, after my second H1B extension got approved in March 2017, I came to India to attend a wedding assuming that my visa interview will go smoothly but I am wrong. We went to visa interview and the visa officer asked about my PhD and my job location etc. My wife was asked whether she is working or not. We told the facts and the officer gave us whiteslip.

He saw my I797, passport and my offer letter, and gave me a yellow slip to wait. I waited for 2 hours and the same person called me again and gave my 221G blue slip, mentioned Administrative processing.

Federal ITRs of the petitioner for the last 2 years. Client Letter, Contract letters etc
I submitted the docs through e-mail on 5-June but unfortunately I didn't receive any auto generated response. Though I submitted the docs 5 times but no confirmation. Then again I sent the docs to support-india and finally got the confirmation. Then after waiting 2 months time I sent e-mail to ustraveldocs.com asking for status , and I got the reply that my case is on hold due to tax returns and JD, and suggested to submit through drop box facility , So I submitted the docs on 18-Aug along with original 221 letter and passport as they were not accepting the docs without passport so I submitted , today I checked my status and its showing passport is still with the embassy, don't know how much time they will take more.

Hopefully it will be available by tomorrow.

Documents were initially dropped off in the drop box on April 17th. Status indicated Administrative Processing on the 18th. Consulate called on 22nd asking to appear for interview on 24th. Passport returned during the interview with a statement that I might need my passport for travel to other places. Case updated on 24th but still indicates Administrative Processing. Wife's H4 was issued right after the documents were dropped off in the drop box. Case updated on 17th may but status still indicated Administrative processing. Received an email from consulate on 19th to submit my passport. Submitted it on the 22nd. Case updated on 23rd with status still indicating Administrative Processing. Case updated on 24th with status still indicating Administrative Processing. Passport tracker indicated the passport is with US consulate. Case updated on May 31 but status remained unchanged. Case updated to "issued" on June 2nd. Passport tracker indicated "ready for pick-up" on June 5th. Picked up my passport right away. The visa stated that clearance was received on May 17th. This experience has shown me the dark side of American bureaucracy. The processing was slow at each step and it reflects the intangible fact that the government is very insensitive towards non-immigrant workers.

I came to renew my F1 visa for my PhD program in Human genetics at University of Chicago. I was eligible for the dropbox submission that did not require me to interview. I submitted my applications through that program initially, on april 17th. My passport was returned on april 22nd, with no visa inside, but a white letter asking me to appear for an interview at the consulate. I appeared for one the following day, on apriil 23rd in Mumbai. After my interview, I was handed a green letter demanding several documents from me that I submitted the following day on april 24th. Still no news of my processing. There is enormous work pending in my lab, and I am unsure if/when I can return.

I was given white slip at the visa interview. The VO asked general questions and said my case has to undergo administrative processing. I have submitted the documents on 20-Apr-2017. I recently received an email asking me to submit my passport. I have submitted it on Monday. Still my case is in administrative processing. Please advise if any of you are in a similar situation. Usually how long does it take to get my passport back after stamping from the date of passport submission?

Strange thing happened, I was issued a Yellow Slip with Admin processing written, All my documents have been taken by VO including original petition paper 797. Passport was returned by VO and I was asked to call the VFS no after two weeks to know the status of the case. I am little worried as usually they give back papers and taken passport while issuing Yellow Slip. Any idea or similar experiences

My ppt and court docs were returned with another yellow 221g slip asking to submit panel physician report on 03/24. Submitted panel physician report from Max along with PPT and same court documents on 04/03 which embassy received on 04/05. Status still says "Admin Processing" as of 04/12 with case last updated 03/10. Any ideas as to how much it will take ?

Generic questions like Company name, address, pay, highest degree, graduation date, university. The officer emphasized about my OPT and asked me the months during which I was on OPT. After the interview, officer said, he cannot make a decision at that moment, and there is nothing to worry about, it is just a computer thing on their side. He said they will let me know the decision in a week (but not guaranteed). He said if for some reason Visa is not granted, I will be notified.

They rejected my visa, put my case under 221 G and told me that they need time to review the case and therefore your case has been put under administrative processing. Time limit they have mentioned that it may take short or it may take long depending upon pending cases. I have applied for K1 visa and have been rejected second time, however this time they have not returned my case to USCIS as the did last time and instructed me to wait. My point of concern is that they have mentioned in rejected in a white letter that they have given me. If it is rejected, what if the point of saying that they will contact me as soon as possible.

Feb 10th, 2017
The interview lasted for 30 secs. I did my MS and utilized OPT+STEM EXtn and now on H1-B. Came for first H1-B stamping and got stuck. The VO handed over white slip and told that we need to verify if I was out of status or not during my college/OPT/PostOPT/H1-B. Since I have lots of gaps of unemployment during my OPT but didn't accrue unemployment days > 120 days.

Guys, this is just an information my friend shared with me and I wanted to share with you people. Please note that this may not be applicable to you and remember each individual's case is different. One of my friends had an interview for H-1B and he had quite a friendly chat with the VO. As told by the VO, apparently the DHS upgraded their systems and there was some glitch (? not sure what is is) which restricts the consular offices to obtain CPT/OPT/SEVIS information of the past F-1 students on the fly. So, if you are currently on F-1 OPT or previously held an F-1 stamp and interviewed for H-1B visa, expect a delay of about 4-5 days (normally, but may extend depending on the situation). Especially, if they've retained your passport and haven't requested for any additional documents, this is most likely the scenario. Again, your case may be specific and this MAY NOT be the exact and only issue with your application.

After nearly 4 months, I got my 221g case approved. I got my VISA and I am back in USA. Key thing is that 'NEVER LOSE HOPE'. Another important thing is that, you need to keep mailing the consulate every 2-3 weeks. i did same thing. They did not come to me as it is. Earlier I was waiting for my decision, but still it was showing as "Pending". But when I did email on 5th June, I received a reply saying "your case is ready for final processing, hence submit passport". such a relief at that point of time

Hi, I have appeared for Visa Interview on 1st Feb with my dependents(Wife and Kid). Questions went on like petitioner, client, address and how long married. The visa officer asked are we(Myself and my Wife) first cousins. Yes we are related prior to marriage and said Yes. She told it needs additional processing and gave a 221 G white slip. Later after 2 days got a mail stating as below “You applied for a nonimmigrant visa at the U.S. Consulate General in Hyderabad. Your nonimmigrant visa application received every possible consideration consistent with U.S. immigration law; however, you did not qualify for visa issuance for marriage between first cousins in TX is a criminal offense.” Can you please kindly advice on the below?. 1.	Any idea on what will be the outcome for my(H1B) visa status, currently showing as administrative processing?. 2.	Is there any possibility to reprocess for my dependents to take them to Texas?

Tax Returns of company
Jan 24th, 2017
The website initially forced me to do dropbox at VFS, so I submitted my I-797 and passport to VFS along with the form. 6-7 business days later, I received the passport back with no stamp, but a blue 221g sheet. The slip had various items ticked, asking for several documents from my company. Some of those documents (such as tax returns of the company, wage reports, a list of employee salaries and immigration statuses etc.) were deemed confidential, so my company could not share it with me. But they offered to email it directly to the consulate (Chennai) to the email address stated on the 221g sheet (even though that line item was not check marked). The day after they sent the docs, I went for my interview. At the interview (on Jan 23), the consular officer asked for all the docs. I told him some of them had been emailed directly. He initially said "Oh no, they shouldn't have done that", but after I stated that some of them were of confidential nature, he said "Yeah, I understand", and took my passport and the few docs that I had with me (project description, payslips, offer letter, copy of petition). He then asked me a series of questions about my company and the nature of my job. He then asked me to wait, so I was seated inside the consulate, watching other interviews take place. 2 hours later, they called me into a separate counter (at the end of the counter windows), where one of the support staff (not a consular officer) asked me questions about my pay slips (she couldn't understand where the correct YTD payment amount was stated, so I clarified that). I then told her that the remaining items have been emailed directly to the consulate. I was then again made to wait for 1 more hour. After that, the consular officer (who had interviewed me earlier) called me back and informed me that one of the docs my company had sent over was password protected. Since it was against the consulate policy to open password-protected docs, he handed me another 221g blue sheet with just that one item tick marked, asking my company to resend it without the password-protection. My company sent it over the very next day (Jan 24). I did not hear back for several days. I wrote to the ustraveldocs support email and they asked me to wait for 60 days before contacting them for an update. On the 60-day mark, I asked them again, and 4 days later, they responded with another generic response, stating that my case was still undergoing Admin Processing, and that they cannot provide a time estimate. The 100-day mark came and went. I then asked my company to email the consulate for an update. 3 days later, I received an email from the consulate asking for my passport to be dropped at the nearest VFS. 5 business days after that I finally got my visa. It is hard to say why the delays have been this rampant off late. According to an unreliable source, embassies have apparently increased the extent of background checks, which may be causing all these delays. Regardless of your stellar academic background and great work experience, you are still susceptible to these delays and uncertainties, which makes life extremely frustrating. You wouldn't be wrong to think about giving up on this whole visa thing and just starting afresh in India.

I had most of these documents except a copy of the i-129 petition. The VO first asked me for the i797, then the client letter, letter from employer, -- then when he asked me for the i129, I told him I was not in possession of it at that moment. The interview paused abruptly there and I was handed a blue slip. What a lot of people do not understand (like myself at the time of the interview) is that the DHS officials at the consulate treat the application as a fresh one although the USCIS has already been through the same set of documents and issued a visa based on beneficiary's eligibility.

I came to India for vacation and went for interview on 19th Jan'17. I received 221g in 2014 as well during my first visa interview and at that time it took 90 days to clear. this is my second time and already completed five weeks. following up with consulate and receiving standard reply. Questions: As per consulate's standard reply most administrative processing takes 60 days,Calendar or Working? do we have someone in this forum who receives 221g second time?if yes how much days it took to get this cleared?

VO asked questions about my education, job description, job location and head office location. She gave me 221g white slip, took the entire petitioner's packet and returned the passport. She said that if I do not hear back within 5 business days, I should contact them. I sent an email after 5 days, got a standard automatic return email within seconds that the administrative process takes time. Still waiting

I was working for a US Company in California for the last 2 years in OPT(f1 visa). I got my H1B approved in 2016, and is in H1 visa from October 1st 2016. I came to India for stamping on December 26th 2016. I had my H1B Visa interview on Jan 6th, And was given a 221g form, the form just had tick mark on the box saying "Need additional administrative processing". My passport was not collected. And after couple of weeks on January 19th 2017 I got a email saying documents are ready for pickup at a pickup location. It contained the I 797A form and some documents that I had submitted during the interview. Along with those documents, I was given a new 221g asking me to submit the following - The contract between employer and client - bank statement and payslip of 2016 - client and vendor letter I submitted them on 7th February in an email to ChennaiH&L@state.gov as demanded. The documents were submitted in a google-drive-link as it exceeded the maximum attachable size in an email. But on Feb 21st I was asked to submit docs as attachments like (Part1, Part2,...) Now its 24rd March and I am still waiting. My client asked me to stop working until I get back.

I am a student in OPT STEM transitioning from an F-1 to an H-1B visa. Once I got to the H-1B interview, the VO told me that there was a problem in their system with my F-1 visa. For this reason, he could not approve my H-1B immediately, and that the US Department of Sate needed to be contacted first. My interview was on Thursday, December 15th, and the VO said that in the best case scenario, my visa would be approved on Tuesday, December 20th. This is so damn frustrating. I am wasting money and vacation days in Mexico and my company in the US is getting annoyed. UPDATE 1: Status updated to "21 December 2016", but still under AP. UPDATE 2: Status updated to "Issued" on 22 December 2016. Picked up my visa that same day at the embassy, and travelled to the US the next day. Best of luck to all.

Went to interview on Dec 14th with family. Kid is US citizen and Consular Officer immediately guessed it. Usual Q&A, and we were having a great conversation with CO. I was happy with how the interview was going and was almost certain that I got the visa. However at the end she stared at the screen for long time and told me that she needs additional info from my employer, wrote 221g and asked for 4 documents under petitioner section. Me - slightly shocked - Mam, I have all those documents with me right now. Can I show you? CO - Sorry you would have to email those to this ID. We will process your application after we get the documents. Me - Thanks, and left disappointed. Submitted the documents on Dec 19th and got automated acknowledgement. Now waiting. I am on EVC model. Updates - 02/01 - Received email to submit passport 02/07 - Received passport with visa 02/13 - Traveled to US. Immigration was very smooth. Good luck to all waiting.

On the day of the interview, the officer asked us to email the mentioned documents and said that there would n't be any problem as long as I submitted them in time and that we should be expecting to get our visas in 3 to 4 days. However, we realized that there are no visas stamped in our passports when we received them. We rushed to the consulate to figure out what happened. One of the officers said that they received to documents and reviewing them currently. It would take anywhere from 60 days to 90 days for this process. We did not want to spend 2 months in Canada, so we flew to our home country.

Resume, List of Publications, University offer letter, Summary of work done/to be done in future.
Nov 28th, 2016
I have already been in US for 1 year on J1 visa (for research scholars). My Visa stamp (on passport) was for one year and it got expired before I returned to India. I could have stayed in US using new DS2019 form given to me by university but I needed to come to India and to go back I needed valid visa stamp. I applied for Visa and the system said I dont need to attend Interview and I just need to dropoff DS2019 and passport. I submitted documents on 9th Nov after coming to India. However when I went to collect the passport after 4 days I found a document mentioning that I need to attend the interview. I was not required to schedule a date. I went for interview on 25th of Nov and to my surprise after asking what I do the interviewer gave me a 221G and returned my passport. My fields of research (High-performance Computing, Clustering) are not listed as sensitive. I submitted the required document on 28th Nov and still waiting for a decision from consulate.

I work as a full time employee for a well known company.VO said that she is approving the visa and needs couple of days for Administrative Processing from their end. She neither asked for any documents nor she gave any 221(g). My visa status still shows Administrative processing. When I check the status of passport, it says there is no status update available for the passport # submitted. On dec 13 the case was updated to AP again and on dec 14th, its updated to issued.

===== Update ==== Oct 21 : Interview Oct 24: Document submitted Nov 27 : Status date changed but still AP Nov 28 : Status changed to Issued. Background : PhD in Computer Science, I work at a security research company, I'm assuming it is issued under TAL. Visa Experience : Only 2 question asked was about PhD/current research. If I am married (which I'm not). Kept typing something and finally said we need more information. Documents kept: Only passport, full time employment letter, photocopy of I129 approved. Effort from the company : US senator's office had enquired DOS about my case on behalf of the company. I'm not sure if that helped. Conclusion : Its been an annoyingly long process.

I was similarly issued a 221g when I applied to renew my F-1 visa about 4 years ago.

AFter than she mentioned that my petition details are not updated properly in the system and needs some 'Administrative Processing' and i will know the result in couple of days.

I was told their is no time limit on how long this will take and nothing we can do until they complete the investigation. We were turned down because husband is from Ghana and I'm from USA and they think our marriage is a "scam".

I had received the 221G in 2012 as well when I was beginning my PhD, which ay have lead to them reimposing 221g on me. I submitted the documents requested on the 12th of June by email, but did not receive any confirmation of receipt of documents, so I contacted the service center for help. I resent my documents to the service center and my case was updated on the 16th of June.

Just gave a white slip and said they will need to verify my client letter and job details. They said it requires administrative processing. They did not take my passport.
Nothing. I got email after 2 months to submit passport and then I submitted passport, then they sent it with stamping.
nan
The VO said that it will take one month or so to verify the details of the client and letters that were submitted by me. They took the originals of the letters from the client. They did verify everything from the client.

Very very urgent matter please escalate my case on an urgent note. We have done our Interview on 1st of Feb 2016 at New Delhi Embassy, and till now we have not received any news from USCIS ...please let me know what is the actual status. The visa consular officer collected our passports and said we would be getting them back in few days. However, when I checked the visa status @CEAC site, it shows the status as "Administrative Processing" I am really worried about what the actual status is? Please Note: I was not given any 221-g form or any other slip/form. I request please update me the current status asap it's really urgent now. If you have any queries please do revert.
